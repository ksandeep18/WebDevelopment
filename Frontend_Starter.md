## HTML and CSS Basics

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the backbone or skeleton of any webpage. It provides the basic structure by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and buttons. Without HTML, a browser wouldn’t know what content to display or how to organize it. You write HTML code using text editors like **VS Code**, **Notepad++**, or even basic **Notepad**, and save it with a `.html` extension. Web browsers like **Chrome** or **Firefox** then read this code and display the structure of the webpage accordingly.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** works alongside HTML to style and beautify that structure. If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is like the clothing and design that make a webpage visually appealing. CSS allows you to add colors, change fonts, adjust layouts, and apply animations or effects to your HTML elements. Together, **HTML and CSS** form the foundation of web development, where HTML handles **content and structure**, and CSS handles **presentation and style**.
## Bootstrap Basics

**Bootstrap** is a popular **CSS framework** that helps you design beautiful and responsive websites quickly. Instead of writing all the CSS from scratch, Bootstrap provides a collection of **pre-written CSS and JavaScript classes** for common web components like buttons, forms, navigation bars, grids, modals, and more. This saves time and ensures your site looks clean and consistent across different devices.

One of the best features of Bootstrap is its **grid system**, which makes it easy to create layouts that automatically adjust for different screen sizes (like phones, tablets, and desktops). You simply include Bootstrap in your project (either by using a CDN link or downloading it), and then use its ready-to-use classes in your HTML. It's perfect for beginners and professionals who want to build responsive, mobile-friendly websites efficiently.
## JavaScript (JS) Basics

**JavaScript (JS)** is a programming language used to make websites **interactive and dynamic**. While **HTML** gives the structure and **CSS** adds style, **JavaScript** brings the webpage to life by allowing you to respond to user actions like clicks, typing, form submissions, and more. For example, when a user clicks a button and a popup appears or a form gets validated before submission — that's JavaScript in action.

JavaScript runs directly in the browser (like Chrome or Firefox) and doesn't need any extra setup to start with. You write JS code either directly in your HTML file inside `<script>` tags or in separate `.js` files. With JavaScript, you can create animations, update content without refreshing the page, build games, and even develop full web apps. It’s a key part of modern web development, working alongside HTML and CSS to create rich user experiences.
