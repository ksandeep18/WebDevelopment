# 🌐 Web Development Journey

Welcome to my **Web Development** repository!  
This space documents my complete learning path, projects, and hands-on practice using both frontend and backend tools — focused on building real-world, scalable web applications from scratch.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

### 💻 Backend:
- **Flask** – Lightweight backend framework
- **Django** – Full-stack framework for rapid development
- **SQLite** – Simple embedded database for local testing
- **PostgreSQL** – Production-ready database
- **SQLAlchemy** – ORM for Python DB interaction
- **psycopg2** – PostgreSQL adapter for Python

### 🎨 Frontend:
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** – Core web building blocks
- **Bootstrap** – Responsive design framework
- **Vue.js** – Modern frontend framework for reactive UIs

## 📘 What's Inside

Each folder or project includes:
- 🔧 Setup instructions and environment configs
- 📝 Notes and references on issues I faced

## 💡 Projects & Learnings so Far

### 📌 **Quiz Master (My Recent Project)**
An interactive quiz platform where users can:
- Register/login
- Attempt MCQs with a timer
- View scores and past attempts

**Tech Highlights:**
- Flask + SQLite for backend
- SQLAlchemy for ORM and database modeling
- Bootstrap for UI styling
- JavaScript for timers and interaction

**Challenges Faced:**
- Handling session-based login and flash messages
- Implementing timers using JS for real-time quizzes
- Dynamic form rendering using Jinja templates
- Setting up one-to-many relationships in SQLAlchemy
- Debugging `psycopg2` connection issues with PostgreSQL

---

## 🚀 Goals

> Build a solid understanding of **web architecture** and **full-stack development** by creating scalable, database-driven apps.

- Learn CRUD operations end-to-end
- Work with both raw SQL and ORM
- Master user authentication, sessions, and routing
- Explore deployment on platforms like Heroku or Render

---

## 🎯 Roadmap Ahead

- 🧾 Add more Django-based apps
- 📱 Build RESTful APIs
- 💬 Integrate Vue.js with Flask backend
- 🔐 Explore security (CSRF, XSS prevention, hashing)
- 📊 Add dashboards with Chart.js or Plotly

---

## 📝 Notes & Docs

I'll be maintaining:
- Troubleshooting tips
- Setup guides (Flask, Django, PostgreSQL)
- Differences between ORM vs raw SQL
- Template inheritance, Jinja tricks, etc.

---

## 📅 Timeline

📆 **April – June 2025**: Focused on full-stack projects and deploying production-grade apps for placement readiness.
