# 📘 React.js Overview (Part 1)

React is a **JavaScript library** developed by **Facebook** to build **user interfaces**. It focuses on building **reusable components** that help manage and display data efficiently.

## 🧠 Why Learn React?

- Master the **fundamentals** of component-based architecture.
- Learn how to **render dynamic data**.
- Handle **user events** like clicks and form inputs.
- **Debug** your React apps using tools like React Developer Tools.

## 🔁 React vs. Other Frameworks/Libraries

| Feature         | React       | Vue         | Angular     |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Type            | Library     | Library     | Framework   |
| Flexibility     | High        | Moderate    | Low         |
| Learning Curve  | Moderate    | Easy        | Steep       |

- **React** is a *library* — gives more flexibility and requires integration with other tools.
- **Vue** is a progressive library — easier for beginners with some structure.
- **Angular** is a *full-fledged framework* — comes with built-in tools, less flexibility.

## 🏗️ Components: The Heart of React

- A **React application is a tree of components**.
- Components can be **nested**, forming a **component hierarchy**.
