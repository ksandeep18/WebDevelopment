# üìò Introduction to TypeScript

**TypeScript** is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by **Microsoft**. It is a **typed superset of JavaScript** that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript is designed to develop large applications with better tooling support, improved readability, and early error detection.

By adding **static typing**, interfaces, and advanced features, TypeScript helps developers write more structured and maintainable code, while still being fully compatible with existing JavaScript libraries and codebases.

# üîç Difference Between JavaScript and TypeScript

| Feature                  | JavaScript (JS)                                | TypeScript (TS)                                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type System**          | Dynamic typing                                 | Static typing (with optional annotations)                   |
| **Compilation**          | Interpreted directly by browsers               | Compiles to JavaScript before execution                     |
| **Error Checking**       | Runtime errors                                 | Compile-time error checking                                 |
| **Language Type**        | Scripting language                             | Superset of JavaScript with added features                  |
| **Tooling Support**      | Basic (depends on editor)                      | Rich editor support (IntelliSense, autocomplete, etc.)      |
| **Learning Curve**       | Easy for beginners                             | Slightly steeper, especially with advanced type features     |
| **Interfaces & Generics**| Not supported                                  | Fully supported                                             |
| **Use Case**             | Suitable for small to medium projects          | Ideal for large-scale, maintainable projects                |
